## 0. Development System/Tooling Setup
The below should get you a good foundation for AI coding.  Depending on the type of project, you may choose to use other, alternative, or additional tools.

### AI Selection
I personnaly use Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.7 (more specifically claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219).  Gemini Pro 2.5 and OpenAI's models, and possibly Deepseek, are also known to be good.  In any case, you more than likely will need an API key.  I subscribed to Anthropic's [CLaude Max plan](https://www.anthropic.com/news/max-plan) to keep my costs low as the API charges were getting expensive with Claude (API costs vary by model - may be worth exploring).  You will be using a combination of chat within a model and API to enable the below processes.

>**Note**: be VERY carefule with protecting your API key - if a nefarious person/organization gets your key, they can quickly run up many thousands of dollars of charges at your expense.

### Coding Environment
I have used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Cline](https://cline.bot/) extension, but have more recently switched to [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).  If you are Windows native, Claude Code runs in a WSL2 environment on Windows, so be aware of this additional setup and usage complexity.  Other options are set up a VM on Windows to run a Linux VM or set up a cheap VPS in the cloud.  Ask your AI how to set any of that up.

I have not used windsurf or cursor, but they are popular options as well.

Use the documentation to install the tool(s) of your choice.

One thing to try to keep current on is the "rules" you load into your tool (varies by tool), some of which are general rules and some of which will be project/technology specific.  This will dramatically affect the quality of the output.  See the various rules files examples in this reporsitory (which may not be up to date), and definitely use AI and Google to look for rules files.  Here is a repository set up for Cline, but these rules will probably work in any tool: https://github.com/cline/prompts/tree/main/.clinerules

### Node.js
For many MCPs (see below) as well as building certain types of apps, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.  Install the latest version.

### Python
For many MCPs (see below) as well as building certain types of apps, you will need [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.  As of May 2025, 3.11 should work fine, but do your own research.  I would install 3.11 or higher.

Additionally, you may need UV to go along with Python: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

### MCP Servers
Installing MCP servers can be a bit tricky and varies by environment.  You may need to install Node packages or Python packages prior to configuring your tool.  

Here are the instructions for:  
[Claude Desktop](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp)  
[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/tutorials#set-up-model-context-protocol-mcp)  
[VS Code Cline](https://cline.bot/mcp-marketplace)  

I suggest installing the following MCP servers:  
[github](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)  
[context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7)  
[taskmaster-ai](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master)  
[desktop-commander](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP)  
[playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)

Depending on the type of project you are building, other MCP servers may be helpful.

## 1. Business Requirements - BRD
### About
#### Business Requirements Document (BRD) Overview

A Business Requirements Document (BRD) captures the high-level business needs and requirements for a project or initiative. It serves as a foundation for all subsequent project documentation.

Once the initial BRD is complete, feel free to come back and revise / augment the BRD as the project progresses.

#### What IS Typically in a BRD:

- **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of the project's purpose and business justification
- **Project Goals and Objectives**: Clear, measurable outcomes the project aims to achieve
- **Business Requirements**: Detailed description of what the business needs to accomplish
- **Stakeholder Information**: Key stakeholders, their roles, and responsibilities
- **Scope**: Clear boundaries of what is included and excluded from the project
- **Success Criteria**: Metrics to evaluate if the project meets business needs
- **Constraints and Assumptions**: Business limitations, dependencies, and assumptions
- **Risk Assessment**: Identification of potential business risks and mitigation strategies
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: High-level overview of expected costs and benefits
- **Timeline**: Major milestones and expected completion dates

#### What is NOT in a BRD:

- **Technical Solutions**: How the requirements will be implemented technically
- **Detailed System Specifications**: Hardware/software configurations
- **Code Samples**: Programming examples or pseudocode
- **Data Models**: Database schemas or detailed data structures
- **User Interface Designs**: Screen mockups or wireframes
- **Test Cases**: Specific testing scenarios and procedures
- **Implementation Plan**: Detailed deployment strategies
- **Technical Architecture**: System architecture diagrams or specifications
- **Operational Procedures**: Day-to-day management of the solution
- **Detailed Project Schedule**: Task-level project plans with resource assignments

A BRD focuses on the "what" and "why" of business needs, not the "how" of implementation. Technical details belong in subsequent documents like the Functional Requirements Document (FRD) or Technical Requirements Document (TRD).

## 2. UI/UX Design - UI-UX
### About
A **UI/UX Design Guide** (also called a **Design System** or **Design Specification Document**) is a comprehensive reference that defines how user interfaces should look and behave across a digital product or suite of products. It provides a consistent framework for designing user experiences that are intuitive, efficient, accessible, and visually coherent.

In practice, a well-structured design guide accelerates development, reduces inconsistencies, and improves collaboration across teams. For agile environments, I strongly recommend linking this guide to live documentation platforms (e.g., Storybook or Figma components), and having automated checks (e.g., visual regression testing) to ensure adherence. Avoid letting the design guide become a static documentâ€”make it a living system.

Below is a **structured outline** describing the components and purpose of a robust sample UI/UX Design Guide that you can use in your prompt to lead AI to produce an output in this format:

---

#### 1. **Purpose and Scope**

* **Objective**: Define the visual language, interaction models, and usability principles for the application.
* **Scope**: Applicable to all screens, platforms (desktop, web, mobile), and user interaction points within the product ecosystem.
* **Audience**: Designers, developers, product managers, and QA teams.

#### 2. **Design Principles**

* **Consistency**: Uniformity across all components, behaviors, and layouts.
* **Clarity**: Prioritize readability, intuitiveness, and visual hierarchy.
