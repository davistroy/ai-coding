## Discovery Process Instructions

### Phase 1: Initial Scoping and Context

Before beginning detailed process discovery:

1. Review the provided process context, scope, and known challenges
2. Identify all processes that need to be documented within the scope
3. Create a preliminary process inventory with categorization
4. Identify key stakeholders who need to be interviewed
5. Determine the appropriate level of detail for each process
6. Assess data availability for metrics and performance baselines
7. Present a discovery plan with timeline and interview schedule

### Phase 2: Process Discovery Interview Framework

Use progressive elaboration with this structured approach:

**Question Categories:**
- **Scope Questions**: Validate process boundaries and interfaces
- **Flow Questions**: Understand steps, sequences, and decision points
- **Role Questions**: Identify who performs what activities and their responsibilities
- **System Questions**: Document technology, tools, and applications used
- **Data Questions**: Understand information inputs, outputs, and transformations
- **Volume Questions**: Capture transaction volumes, frequencies, and patterns
- **Performance Questions**: Gather metrics, SLAs, and current performance levels
- **Exception Questions**: Identify variations, workarounds, and error handling
- **Pain Point Questions**: Uncover frustrations, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities
- **Compliance Questions**: Document regulatory requirements and controls
- **Risk Questions**: Identify potential failure modes and their impacts

**For each process discovered:**
- Document the process name, purpose, and business value
- Map the end-to-end flow with decision points
- Identify all roles involved (RACI)
- Capture systems and technology touchpoints
- Record current performance metrics (baseline)
- Document known issues and pain points
- Note any compliance or regulatory requirements

**Progressive Flow:**
1. Start with process inventory and categorization
2. Document high-level process flows for all in-scope processes
3. Deep-dive into priority processes with detailed mapping
4. Capture performance data and baselines
5. Document technology and system landscape
6. Identify organizational structure and roles
7. Gather pain points and improvement opportunities
8. Validate findings with process owners

### Phase 3: Validation and Verification

Continue discovery until you can definitively answer:
- What processes exist within the scope and how do they relate to each other?
- What is the end-to-end flow for each process including all variations?
- Who performs each activity and what are their responsibilities?
- What systems and tools support these processes?
- What are the current performance levels (quantified)?
- What are the major pain points and their business impact?
- What compliance and regulatory requirements apply?
- What are the costs associated with these processes?
- What risks exist in the current state?

### Phase 4: Pre-Document Validation

Before producing the final Current State document, present a comprehensive summary:

**Process Inventory Summary**: All processes documented with categorization
**Key Metrics Overview**: Performance baselines for critical processes
**Technology Landscape**: Systems supporting the processes
**Organizational View**: Roles and responsibilities summary
**Critical Pain Points**: Top issues with quantified business impact
**Risk Assessment**: Key risks identified in current operations
**Data Quality Notes**: Confidence levels in captured information
**Information Gaps**: Areas where additional discovery may be needed

Allow review, refinement, and approval of this summary before generating the full document.

**Instructions for Use:**
1. Complete the `<process_context>`, `<assessment_scope>`, `<stakeholder_context>`, and `<known_challenges>` sections above
2. I will guide you through the structured discovery process
3. You will validate findings before producing the final Current State document
4. The resulting document will serve as the foundation for future state design and transformation planning

**Success Criteria for this Document:**
The completed Current State Assessment should:
- Provide a comprehensive, accurate view of how processes operate today
- Quantify performance with baseline metrics for comparison
- Identify and prioritize pain points with business impact
- Document systems, roles, and dependencies clearly
- Highlight risks and compliance considerations
- Enable informed decision-making for transformation initiatives
- Serve as a baseline for measuring future improvements

**Relationship to Other Documents:**
- **Precedes BRD**: Current state assessment informs business requirements by identifying gaps and opportunities
- **Supports PRD**: Provides context for product requirements and user pain points
- **Informs ARCH**: Technology landscape feeds into architecture decisions
- **Enables TDD**: Process details inform technical implementation specifications
